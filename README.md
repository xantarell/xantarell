- 👋 Hi, I’m @xantarell
- 👀 I’m interested in how aesthetics are affecting us in everything we do.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning css and color theory.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on adapting the nord theme (my current favorite) for different applications.
- 📫 How to reach me? You probably don't need to, I'll just find you instead!
